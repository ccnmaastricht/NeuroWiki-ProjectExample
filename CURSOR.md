## Page Types

There are no per-paper pages. Papers are sources synthesized into concept pages. The `.bib` files are the citation layer.

| Prefix | Type | Covers |
|--------|------|--------|
| `PHE_` | Phenomenon | An observed neural or behavioral regularity at any level, including functional network patterns |
| `MOD_` | Computational model | A formal model (mechanistic, normative, or data-driven) making specific, testable claims about a target system |
| `THE_` | Neuroscientific theory | A full theory with explanatory schema, a defined model family, mechanistic grounding, and explicit empirical scope; umbrella theories link to sub-theory THE_ pages |
| `REG_` | Brain region | Anatomically defined structure: location, cytoarchitecture, connectivity |
| `CEL_` | Cell type | Neuronal or glial population defined by morphological, molecular, or functional properties; may span regions |
| `NET_` | Neural circuit / network | Structured connectivity pattern between regions or cell types, at a defined spatial scale |
| `PAR_` | Experimental paradigm | Behavioral task or protocol: what the subject experiences and does; no equipment or analysis details |
| `TECH_` | Technical method | Procedure for acquiring, preprocessing, or stimulating neural/behavioral signals |
| `ANA_` | Analysis method | Post-hoc data analysis procedure: statistics, dimensionality reduction, decoding, inference |
| `SIM_` | Simulation software | Software that instantiates a model and numerically integrates it to produce simulated data |
| `DAT_` | Canonical dataset | Curated, publicly accessible data collection serving as a community reference |

Slug convention: lowercase, hyphenated, descriptive.
Examples: `PHE_place-cell-remapping`, `MOD_ring-attractor`, `REG_v1`, `CEL_pv-interneuron`, `NET_basal-ganglia-thalamic-loop`, `PAR_morris-water-maze`, `TECH_two-photon-imaging`, `ANA_population-decoding`, `SIM_nest`, `DAT_allen-brain-atlas`

## Citation Model

| Notation | Meaning | Source |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `(@OKeefe1971)` | Verified from a PDF in `raw/` | `primary.bib` |
| `(@Buzsaki2015†)` | Reconstructed from another paper's citation | `secondary.bib` |

The `†` dagger is never optional. Omitting it on a secondary citation misrepresents the reliability of a claim.

Citation key format: `AuthorYYYY`. Collisions: `Buzsaki2015a`, `Buzsaki2015b`.
Keys are stable across promotion: `(@Key†)` becomes `(@Key)` — the key itself does not change.

**primary.bib** — one entry per PDF in `raw/`. All fields verified against the PDF. Required field:
```
annote = {<one-line description of main contribution>}
```

**secondary.bib** — reconstructed from citations within PDFs. Uncertain fields flagged:
```
note = {reconstructed from @SourceKey}
```

## Confidence Levels and Theory Status

### Confidence (PHE_, MOD_, REG_, CEL_, NET_, TECH_, ANA_ pages)

Every `PHE_`, `MOD_`, `REG_`, `CEL_`, `NET_`, `TECH_`, and `ANA_` page must carry a confidence field. Default to `speculative` when evidence is thin.

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `established` | Replicated across multiple independent labs, species, or methods; field consensus. Requires at minimum two independent sources. |
| `debated` | Genuine disagreement in the literature; conflicting evidence or interpretations exist |
| `speculative` | Based on limited evidence, a single study, or theoretical inference without strong empirical grounding |

Confidence upgrades and downgrades both require a note citing the motivating evidence. Add or extend the **Controversies** section to record this; create the section if it does not yet exist.

> **Note**: `speculative` reflects thin evidence, not design purpose. A MOD_ page with `exploratory: true` is not speculative by default — exploratory models are legitimate epistemic stages regardless of evidence quality. Distinguish evidence quality (confidence field) from explanatory status (`explanatory_character`, `marr_level`, and **Explanatory Scope** section).

### Status (THE_ pages)

`THE_` pages do not carry a confidence field. Instead they carry a neutral **Status** field.

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `emerging` | Has an explanatory schema and initial formal models but the model family is not yet mature |
| `active-research-area` | The theory is actively developed, debated, and applied in current research |
| `settled` | The theory is broadly accepted; major disputes resolved; still used but no longer a frontier |
| `abandoned` | The theory has been superseded or discredited and is no longer actively pursued |

## Behavioral Rules

1. Never modify files in `raw/`.
2. Never fabricate citations. Unresolvable secondary references: `<!-- UNRESOLVED: <description> -->`.
3. The `†` dagger is mandatory on every secondary citation.
4. Equations before prose on all MOD_ pages.
5. PHE_, REG_, CEL_, and NET_ pages describe observations. MOD_ pages describe proposals. THE_ pages describe theories and their explanatory architecture. SIM_ pages describe software that implements models, not the models themselves. Never conflate.
6. Confidence is mandatory on every PHE_, MOD_, REG_, CEL_, NET_, TECH_, and ANA_ page.
7. Cross-link using `[[TYPE_slug]]` within page bodies. Use relative paths in `index.md`.
8. Flag uncertainty with `> ⚠️ Uncertain: <reason>`.
9. Rewrite, don't append. Git history is the changelog.
10. Promotions are content reviews, not find-and-replace. Re-evaluate every claim previously citing the secondary source against the actual PDF.
11. End every session by appending a log entry to `wiki/log.md` using the format in the **Session Log** section below, then printing the entry to the conversation. The final line of every entry must be `**Sign-off**: *(pending)*` — the human replaces this with `**Sign-off**: ✓ Verified — <name>, <date>` after completing the checklist in `docs/VERIFICATION.md`.
12. Every MOD_ page must populate `explanatory_character`, `marr_level`, `construction`, and `exploratory` in the frontmatter, and the **Explanatory Scope** section in the body. State level-relativity explicitly — phenomenological at one level and mechanistic at another are not contradictory and both must appear. If `marr_level` includes `computational` and the model makes a normative claim, state the objective or optimality principle in the Explanatory Scope section.

## Session Log

Every session ends by appending a new entry to `wiki/log.md`, directly after the opening `---` separator (newest entry first). Print the entry to the conversation as well.

Each workflow file specifies what goes in the **Changes** section; everything else is standard across all session types.

```markdown
## Session YYYY-MM-DD — <Ingestion: filename.pdf | Structural Harmonization | Depth Audit | Cross-Link Audit | Review: session-date>

**Run by**: <name or "agent">

### Changes

<session-specific content — see workflow file for exact fields>

### Flags raised
- ⚑ Human review: <page — issue, or "none">
- `<!-- UNCITED -->`: <page — claim summary, or "none">
- `<!-- UNRESOLVED -->`: <description, or "none">

### Flags resolved this session
- <list, or "none">

### Action items
- <list, or "none">

**Sign-off**: *(pending)*
```

The human replaces `*(pending)*` with `✓ Verified — <name>, <date>` after completing the post-session checklist in `docs/VERIFICATION.md`. The CI validator rejects lab wiki submissions that contain any `*(pending)*` entry.
